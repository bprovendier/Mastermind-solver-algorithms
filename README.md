# Mastermind-solver-algorithms
Imperial College London Year 1 Software Engineering Project

This project was made as part of the *Software Engineering: Introduction to programming* module for First Year Electrical and Electronics Engineering course.
The goal was to design a program made out of different algorithms to solve any game of mastermind up to 15 pings each having 15 possibilities in less than 10 seconds in as little attempts at possible. This C++ program is the final submission for that assignment and includes a combination of three algorithms as detailed in the report. 

This assignment received the maximum grade of **A** and was deemed to be **effective**.
